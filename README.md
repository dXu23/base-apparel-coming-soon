## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the ::after pseudo selector, as well as about the :invalid pseudo-selector.

### Useful resources

- [CSS stying form input validity][https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-styling-form-input-validity] - This helped me figure out why ::after wasn't working with input
- [Invalid selector][https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/i/invalid/] - This short reference taught me about the :invalid pseudo selector.
